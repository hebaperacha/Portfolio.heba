The zoo gives you a good experience and you get to see lots of animals, the mosques are very beautiful and amazing place to visit, and the beach is also really exciting and fun. And lastly the third option you choose Scotland and get to choose what type of transportation you want around the country. Either, a car, taxi, or bus. The car saves you lots of time and you end up getting to the hike safely, but get into a big problem at the end, the taxi costs you lots of money but you are happy in the end because you get to see your favorite waterfall, and the bus makes you exgaused since you had to stand the whole ride so your trip was ruined. \n ");
